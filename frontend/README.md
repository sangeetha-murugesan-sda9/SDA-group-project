## InStyle

## Introduction
This application is a Social Media Application for Stylists built with gradle.
The social media era is well and truly underway and photo sharing app is one 
of the biggest hot topic social platforms.This application is for Style Competition.Every user in our app is a stylist.
Every user can submit their styles (photo) and they can vote for other user's styles.Everyday we have a 
winner who has the highest number of (likes) votes.
He/She can decide best styles and vote for it.

## Getting Started
The web application is made up of three parts: database, backend  (Spring)
and frontend (React).The application can run directly via Gradle. The code for this 
application uses the Gradle build tool (https://gradle.org.).Instructions for
installing Gradle are available in the official documentation(https://gradle.org/install)
which describes several options.

Getting started is simple. The User have to register and login.

1.Create a username and password. 
2.Fill in your profile information.
3.You can upload images to your Instyle profile right away.
4.You can like other users’ photos by tapping the fire icon.
That’s it, you’re all set to start posting some great images and ready for Style 
competion.

## Front-end React
Front-end for this application is built with Create React App.

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd frontend
npm install --save particles-bg
npm start 

```

_If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, its recommended to uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` or `yarn global remove create-react-app` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version._

_[npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher._

_Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the application.<br>_


## How to Run the Application
The application can also be run via terminal with the Gradle.

```
./gradlew bootRun
```
To Stop Running the Application:

```
Crtl + C
```
## Setup
We need to configure the following dependencies in `build.gradle`:

```Dependencies:
plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.2.0.RELEASE'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.0.8.RELEASE'
    id 'java'
}

group = 'se.kth.sda'
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
sourceCompatibility = '11'

configurations {
    developmentOnly
    runtimeClasspath {
        extendsFrom developmentOnly
    }
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    developmentOnly 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools'
    compile group: 'com.auth0', name: 'java-jwt', version: '3.8.3'
    implementation group: 'commons-io', name:'commons-io', version:'2.6'
    runtimeOnly 'org.postgresql:postgresql'
}
```

`src/main/resources/application.properties` should be configured:
```properties
spring.jpa.database=POSTGRESQL
spring.datasource.platform=postgres
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5431/skeleton
spring.datasource.username=skeleton_user
spring.datasource.password=skeleton_pass
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.generate-ddl=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.lob.non_contextual_creation=true
spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=300MB
spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=300MB

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect= org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
```
## DataBase Setup
A Dockerized PostgreSQL database:

The docker-compose.yaml is manually created.
To create docker-compose from the terminal ,we need to use the command
```touch docker-compose.yaml ```

and docker-compose.yaml should contain the following.
```docker-compose.yaml
version: "3"
services:
  database:
    image: postgres:13-alpine
    environment:
       - POSTGRES_DB=skeleton
